**About Wall-e**

This is a Turtlebot Waffle that can recognize cubes and follow them using machine learning.
We used a PS3 camera and YOLOv5 for the cube recognition.
When the cube is on the left side of the camera, the Turtlebot will move to the left with the mission to center it, and then it will move forward to it.
The same happens when the cube is on the right side.
